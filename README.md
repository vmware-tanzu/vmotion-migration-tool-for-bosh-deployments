```

To make an official release on GitHub, make a git tag with the new version and push it. The GitHub Release Action
will run on any new pushed tags. Once complete the new release artifacts will show up on the GitHub releases page.
For example to release version v0.3.2 use the following commands:

git push origin --tags
```
